Installing Using Installer Package
==================================

  This section provides information specific to GraphicsMagick installed
  via a "setup.exe" style installation wizard under Microsoft Windows. It
  applies only to the pre-built "binaries" package, and not to versions
  compiled from source code. If you would like to install GraphicsMagick
  from source code, then please refer to the Installing From Source Code
  section.

Prerequisites
-------------

  While multiple versions of GraphicsMagick may be installed at one
  time, if your intention is to replace a prior installation of
  GraphicsMagick with a newer version, then it is wise to uninstall
  the existing GraphicsMagick (see uninstall procedure) prior to
  installing the newer version.

  While it is not a requirement, it is strongly recommended that the
  `Ghostscript <http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/>`_
  package (GraphicsMagick is tested with version 9.10) be
  installed. GraphicsMagick uses Ghostscript to render Postscript and
  PDF files, as well as formats where a translator to Postscript is
  available. GraphicsMagick will use the `Ghostscript Fonts
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/gs-fonts/>`_ to support the
  standard set of Adobe Postscript fonts like "Helvetica" and "Times
  Roman" if these fonts are not available as TrueType fonts.  The
  Ghostscript fonts need to manually installed with administrator
  privileges in the Ghostscript installation directory.

  Make sure to install a Ghostscript which is compatible with the
  GraphicsMagick you are installing.  For example, if you are
  installing a 64-bit GraphicsMagick, you should install a 64-bit
  Ghostscript.  The installation order of the two packages is not
  important.  Both 32 and 64-bit versions of GraphicsMagick and
  Ghostscript may be installed at the same time.

  The installation package includes the GraphicsMagick Perl extension
  ( `PerlMagick <perl.html>`_) as an installation option. If you would
  like to use this extension, then you must install `ActiveState
  ActivePerl <http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads/>`_
  prior to commencing with installation of GraphicsMagick.

Retrieve Install Package
------------------------

  Retrieve the GraphicsMagick Windows binary install package from a one
  of the ftp sites listed at the `GraphicsMagick Download Sites
  <download.html>`_ page. The available install packages are as follows

  Windows Dynamic-Multithread (DLL-based) install package with utilities,
  PerlMagick, ImageMagickObject COM object, and web pages:

    ::

      GraphicsMagick-1.3-Q8-win32-dll.exe
      GraphicsMagick-1.3-Q16-win32-dll.exe
      GraphicsMagick-1.3-Q8-win64-dll.exe
      GraphicsMagick-1.3-Q16-win64-dll.exe

  Note that the QuantumDepth=8 version (Q8) which provides industry
  standard 24/32 bit pixels consumes half the memory and about 30% less
  CPU than the QuantumDepth=16 version (Q16) which provides 48/64 bit
  pixels for high-resolution color. A Q8 version is fine for processing
  typical photos intended for viewing on a computer screen. If you are
  dealing with film, scientific, or medical images, use ICC color
  profiles, or deal with images that have limited contrast, then the Q16
  version is recommended.

  The `win32' packages are for 32-bit or 64-bit Windows, whereas the
  `win64` packages are only for 64-bit Windows.  The 64-bit version
  allows processing larger images in memory (rather than disk files),
  provided that the system has more than 2GB of RAM installed.  Memory
  access is 1000 times faster than disk access.

Start Installation Wizard
-------------------------

  Execute the downloaded file from your browser or by double-clicking on
  the filename from within Windows Explorer. The GraphicsMagick Setup
  Wizard will appear. Click on "*Next>*" to continue.

Read Installation Information
-----------------------------

  An informational screen is presented which provides a summary of things
  you should know before you proceed. Please take care to read this
  information. Once you have finished, Click on "*Next>*" to continue.

Select Destination Directory
----------------------------

  Specify what drive and directory to install GraphicsMagick into.
  Approximately 15MB of free disk space is required to install all of
  GraphicsMagick (you may choose to install a subset to save space). A
  message at the bottom of the screen will tell you exactly how much
  space is required to install the complete package. The default
  installation directory is similar to ``C:\Program
  Files\GraphicsMagick-1.3-Q8``. Once you have entered the desired
  installation directory, then select "*Next>*" to continue.

Select Start Menu Folder
------------------------

  Select the folder where you would like the program's shortcuts to
  appear. The default should normally be satisfactory. Click on "*Next>*"
  to continue.

Select Additional Tasks
-----------------------

  A screen is displayed which presents most (or all) of the following
  options:

  * Create a desktop icon

  * Update executable search path

  * Associate supported file extensions with GraphicsMagick

  * Install PerlMagick for ActiveState Perl v5.14.2 build 1402

  * Install ImageMagickObject OLE Control for VBscript, Visual Basic,
    and WSH.

  "Creating a desktop icon" and "Update the executable search path"
  are selected by default. The remaining options default to
  un-selected.  Select the options you prefer. Note that ActiveState
  Perl packages are intended to be binary compatible across a build
  series.  See the ActiveState Perl documentation for more information
  on this topic.

  Think twice before selecting "*Associate supported file extensions with
  GraphicsMagick*" since this will set up approximately fifty file
  associations, including common formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, TIFF, and
  PDF. These file associations will be to the 'gmdisplay' program which
  is suitable for displaying images, but currently offers little more
  than that. Windows XP seems to handle the file associations pretty
  well, allowing you to choose from a list of programs, but older systems
  like Windows NT 4.0 and Windows '98 only support a single association
  per format, which can be quite annoying. Associations for
  GraphicsMagick's native formats (such as `MIFF <miff.html>`_) will
  always be made.

  Once you have made your selections, click on "*Next>*" to continue.

Ready to Install
----------------

  A screen is displayed which displays the selected options. If you are
  not satisfied with a selected option, then click on "*<Back*" to go back
  to a previous screen so that the option may be adjusted. If you are
  satisfied with the options and are ready to install, then select
  "*Install*". To abort the installation entirely, select "*Cancel*".

Installation Progress
---------------------

  While the install program is performing the installation, it will
  display what it is doing in an installation progress window.


Final Information
-----------------

  A summary of post-install steps is provided. These steps include some
  commands you can execute to make sure that GraphicsMagick is working,
  as well as some notes about what has been installed on your system, and
  where to find additional information. Once you have read this
  information, click on "*Next>*" to continue.

Finishing Up
------------

  By default "*View GraphicsMagick.html*" is check-marked. This causes the
  GraphicsMagick web pages to be displayed in your web browser when
  "*Finish*" is selected. If you do not want to view the web pages, then
  de-select "*View GraphicsMagick.html*". Select "*Finish*" to exit the
  installation program.

Testing The Installation
------------------------

  Select "*Command Prompt*" from the Windows Start menu. Within the window
  type

    ::

      gm convert logo: logo.miff
      gmdisplay logo.miff

  and the GraphicsMagick logo should be displayed in a window.

Uninstall
---------

  The GraphicsMagick package incorporates its own uninstall
  functionality. Always remove an installed GraphicsMagick via its
  uninstall function since manually removing it (such as by removing its
  installation directory) will leave behind the registry entries and path
  settings established at install time.

  Under Windows '95 and Windows '98, use the "*Uninstall*" entry in the
  GraphicsMagick portion of the Windows start menu to initiate the
  uninstall.

  On NT 4.0 and 5.X -based systems, GraphicsMagick should be removed via
  the "*Add or Remove Programs*" area of the Windows Control Panel. Select
  the GraphicsMagick package from the list, and click on "*Change/Remove*"
  to uninstall it.

Use From Another Package or Program
-----------------------------------

  The GraphicsMagick gm utility may be executed as a sub-process by other
  programs. If gm utility is not in the systems executable search path
  (it should be since the GraphicsMagick install extends the path), then
  the utility should be executed via the complete path to the executable.

  The `ImageMagickObject <ImageMagickObject.html>`_ COM object may be
  used to execute the gm sub-functions (e.g. "convert") without spawning
  a new process or causing Windows to pop up a window. The COM object
  supports multi-threaded concurrent use.

  When GraphicsMagick is installed, entries are added to the Windows
  Registry so that other programs may obtain information regarding the
  most recently installed GraphicsMagick. These entries are available
  under the registry path ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\GraphicsMagick\Current``.

  These registry keys are currently available:

  =================  ========  ============================================
  Key Name           Key Type  Description
  =================  ========  ============================================
  BinPath            REG_SZ    Directory where GraphicsMagick executables
                               are installed
  ConfigurePath      REG_SZ    Directory where configuration files are
                               installed
  LibPath            REG_SZ    Directory where GraphicsMagick core DLLs
                               are installed
  CoderModulesPath   REG_SZ    Directory where GraphicsMagick loadable
                               coder modules are installed
  FilterModulesPath  REG_SZ    Directory where GraphicsMagick loadable
                               filter modules are installed
  SharePath          REG_SZ    Directory where configuration files are
                               installed
  =================  ========  ============================================


Installing From Source Code
===========================

Applicability
-------------

  This section provides instructions for building GraphicsMagick
  Microsoft Windows using the Visual C++ (Visual Studio, etc.) IDE. For
  building using the free Cygwin or MinGW compilers, follow the
  instructions in INSTALL-unix.txt.

Important Notes
---------------

  On some platforms Visual C++ may fail with an internal compiler
  error.  If this happens to you, then make sure that your compiler is
  updated with the latest fixes from the Microsoft web site and the
  problem will hopefully go away.  If the problem does not go away,
  then adjust the settings for the module which failed and disable
  optimization, and the problem is likely to go away (but with less
  performance).

Windows XP, Vista, 7 Visual C++ 6.0 through 14.0 Compilation
------------------------------------------------------------

  The Visual C++ distribution targeted at Windows 2000 through Windows
  8 does not provide any stock workspace (DSW) or project files (DSP)
  except for those included with third party libraries. Instead, there
  is a "configure" program that must run to create build
  environments to satisfy various requirements.

  The configure program resides in VisualMagick\configure in the
  GraphicsMagick source tree.  A pre-compiled configure.exe is
  provided, as well as Visual Studio project files to recompile it
  from source code if needed.

  Once started, the configure program provides this configuration
  dialog after proceeding past the initial notifications screen:

  .. image:: configure-target-setup.png
     :height: 485px
     :width: 512px
     :scale: 100%
     :alt: Configure program screen shot
     :align: center

  In addition to (or as a replacement to) the above dialog, the
  configure.exe program supports these command-line options:

  `/Q8 /Q16 /Q32`
             Set quantum depth

  `/x64`
             Add x64 configuration

  `/mtd /sts /mts /mtsd`
             Set project type

  `/noWizard`
             Do not show the wizard

  `/openMP`
             Enable openMP

  The Visual C++ system provides three different types of "runtimes"
  that must match across all application, library, and DLL code that is
  built. The "configure" program creates a set of build files that are
  consistent for a specific runtime selection.

  The three options for runtime support are:

  1) Dynamic Multi-threaded DLL runtimes (VisualDynamicMT), `/mtd` option
  2) Static Single-threaded runtimes (`VisualStaticST`), `/sts` option
  3) Static Multi-threaded runtimes (VisualStaticMT), `/mts` option
  4) Static Multi-threaded DLL runtimes (VisualStaticMTDLL), `/mtsd` option

  In addition to these runtimes, the VisualMagick build environment allows
  you to select whether to include the X11 libraries in the build or not.
  X11 DLLs and headers are provided with the VisualMagick build
  environment. Most Windows users do not use X11 so they will prefer to
  build without X11 support. When X11 is not supported, gm subcommands
  'animate', 'display', and 'import' will not work.

  This leads to five different possible build options, which should
  cover almost any particular situation. The default binary
  distribution is built using #1 from above with the X11 libraries
  excluded. This results build using all DLL's for everything and
  multi-threaded support (the only option for DLL's).

  To do a build for your requirements, simply go to the configure sub-
  directory under VisualMagick and open the configure.dsw workspace (for
  Visual C++ 6.0) or configure.sln (for Visual C++ 7.X or 8.X). Set the
  build configuration to "Release" under the

      "Build..., Set Active Configuration..."  menu.

  Build and execute the configure program and follow the on-screen
  instructions. You should not change any of the defaults unless you have a
  specific reason to do so.

  The configure program provides a button entitled

     Edit "magick_config.h"

  Clicking this button brings up magick_config.h in Windows notepad
  for optionally changing any preprocessor defines in GraphicsMagick's
  magick_config.h file. This file is copied to
  ``magick\magick_config.h``. You may safely open
  ``magick\magick_config.h``, modify it, and recompile without
  re-running the configure program. In fact, using Visual Studio to
  edit the copied file may be preferable since it preserves the
  original magick_config.h file.

  Key user tunables in magick_config.h include:

    QuantumDepth (default 8)

      Specify size of PixelPacket color Quantums (8, 16, or 32) A value of
      8 uses half the memory than 16 and may run 30% faster, but provides
      256 times less color resolution than a value of 16.

    UseInstalledMagick (default undefined)

      Define to build a GraphicsMagick which uses registry settings or
      embedded paths to locate installed components (coder modules and
      configuration files). The default is to look for all files in the
      same directory as the executable.

    ProvideDllMain (default undefined)

      Define to include a DllMain() function ensures that the GraphicsMagick
      DLL is properly initialized without participation from dependent
      applications. This avoids the requirement to invoke IntializeMagick()
      from dependent applications but only works for DLL builds.

    EnableBrokenCoders (default undefined)

      Define to enable broken/dangerous file format support.  Only
      enable this if you have complete control over the input files
      and not for arbitrary files such as uploaded from untrusted
      sources via the Internet.  Currently this must be enabled to
      enable Adobe Photoshop Format (PSD).

  After creating your build environment you can proceed to open the DSW (or
  SLN) file that was generated in the VisualMagick directory and build
  everything from there.

  In the final DSW file you will find a project call "All". In order to
  build everything in the distribution, select this project and make it
  the "active" project. Set the build configuration to the desired one
  (Debug, or Release) and do a "clean" followed by a "build". You should
  do the build in a specific way:

    1) Make the "All" project the active project (Bold)
       Right click on the All project and select "Set As Active Project"
    2) Select "Build..., Clean"
    3) Select "Build..., Build"
    4) Go get some coffee unless you have a very fast machine!.

  The "Clean" step is needed in order to make sure that all of the target
  support libraries are updated with any patches needed to get them to
  compile properly under Visual C++.

  All of the required files that are needed to run any of the command
  line tools will be found in the "bin" subdirectory of the VisualMagick
  subdirectory. This includes EXE, and DLL files. You should be able
  to test the build directly from this directory without having to move
  anything to any of the global SYSTEM or SYSTEM32 areas in the operating
  system installation.

  Note #1:

  The Visual C++ distribution of GraphicsMagick comes with the Magick++
  C++ wrapper by default. This add-on layer has a large number of demo
  and test files that can be found in ``GraphicsMagick\Magick++\demo``, and
  ``GraphicsMagick\Magick++\tests``. There are also a variety of tests that
  use the straight C API as well in ``GraphicsMagick\tests``.

  All of these programs are NOT configured to be built in the default
  workspace created by the configure program. You can cause all of these
  demos and test programs to be built by checking the box in configure
  that says:

    "Include all demo and test programs"

  In addition, there is another related checkbox (checked by default)
  that causes all generated project files to be created standalone so
  that they can be copied to other areas of you system.

  This is the checkbox:

   "Generate all utility projects with full paths rather then relative
   paths"

  WOW - that a mouthfull - eh?

  Visual C++ uses a concept of "dependencies" that tell it what other
  components need to be build when a particular project is being build. This
  mechanism is also used to ensure that components link properly. In my normal
  development environment, I want to be able to make changes and debug the
  system as a whole, so I like and NEED to use dependencies. However, most
  end users don't want to work this way.

  Instead they really just want to build the package and then get down
  to business working on their application. The solution is to make all
  the utility projects (UTIL_xxxx_yy_exe.dsp) use full absolute paths
  to all the things they need. This way the projects stand on their own
  and can actually be copied and used as templates to get a particular
  custom application compiling with little effort.

  With this feature enabled, you should be able to nab a copy of...
    
    ``VisualMagick\utilities\UTIL_gm_xxx_exe.dsp``  (for C)

     -or-

    ``VisualMagick\Magick++\demo\UTIL_demo_xxx_exe.dsp`` (for C++)

  ... and pop it into notepad, modify it (carefully) to your needs and
  be on your way to happy compiling and linking.

  You can feel free to pick any of the standard utilities, tests, or
  demo programs as the basis for a new program by copying the project
  and the source and hacking away.

  The choice of what to use as a starting point is very easy...

  For straight C API command line applications use something from

    ``GraphicsMagick\tests`` or ``GraphicsMagick\utilities`` (source code)

    ``GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\tests`` or ``GraphicsMagick\Visualmagick\utilities``
    (project - DSP)

  For C++ and Magick++ command line applications use something from

    ``GraphicsMagick\Magick++\tests`` or ``GraphicsMagick\Magick++\demo`` (source code)

    ``GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\Magick++\tests`` or
    ``GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\Magick++\demo`` (project - DSP)

  For C++ and Magick++ and MFC windows applications use
   
    ``GraphicsMagick\win2k\IMDisplay`` (source code)

    ``GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\win32\NtMagick`` (project - DSP)

  Note #2:

  The GraphicsMagick distribution is very modular. The default
  configuration is there to get you rolling, but you need to make some
  serious choices when you wish to change things around.

  The default options are all targeted at having all the components in one
  place (e.g. the "bin" directory of the VisualMagick build tree). These
  components may be copied to another folder (such as to another computer).

  The folder containing the executables and DLLs should contain the
  following files:

      1) colors.mgk
      2) delegates.mgk
      3) log.mgk
      4) magic.mgk
      5) modules.mgk
      6) type.mgk
      7) type-ghostscript.mgk (if Ghostscript is used)

  The "bin" folder should contains all EXE's and DLL's as well as the
  very important "modules.mgk" file.

  With this default setup, you can use any of the command line tools
  and run scripts as normal. You can actually get by quite nicely this
  way by doing something like ``pushd e:\xxx\yyy\bin`` in any scripts you
  write to execute "out of" this directory.

  By default the core of GraphicsMagick on Win32 always looks in the place
  were the exe program is run from in order to find all of the files as
  well as the DLL's it needs.

Environment Variables
---------------------

  You can use the "System" control panel to allow you to add and delete
  what is in any of the environment variables. You can even have user
  specific environment variables if you wish.

  PATH

   This sets the default list of places were Windows looks for EXE's and
   DLL's. Windows CMD shell seems to look in the "current" directory first
   - no matter what, which may make it unnecessary to update the PATH. If
   you wish to run any of utilities from another location then you must
   add the path to your "bin" directory in. For instance, you might add:

      ``D:\Devel\GraphicsMagick\VisualMagick\bin``

   to do this for the default build environment like I do.

  MAGICK_HOME

   If all you do is modify the PATH variable, the first problem you
   will run into is that GraphicsMagick may not be able to find any of
   its "modules. Modules are all the IM_MOD*.DLL files you see in the
   distribution. There is one of these for each and every file format
   that GraphicsMagick supports. This environment variable tells the system
   were to look for these DLL's. The compiled in "default" is "execution
   path" - which says - look in the same place that the application is
   running "in". If you are running from somewhere other then "bin" -
   this will no longer work and you must use this variable. If you elect
   to leave the modules in the same place as the EXE's (a good idea)
   then you can simply set this to the same place
   as you did the PATH variable. In my case:

      ``D:\\GraphicsMagick\coders``

   This is also the place were GraphicsMagick expects to find the
   "colors.mgk", "delegates.mgk", "magic.mgk", "modules.mgk", and
   "type.mgk" files.

   One cool thing about the modules build of GraphicsMagick is that you can
   now leave out file formats and lighten you load. If all you ever need
   is GIF and JPEG, then simply drop all the other DLL's into the local
   trash can and get on with your life.

   WARNING: Always keep the "xc" format, since GM uses it for internal
   purposes.

  ALSO. You can elect to changes these things the good old "hard-coded"
  way. Two #defines are applicable.

  defines.h has 

      ``#define MagickConfigurePath  "c:\\GraphicsMagick\\"``

  To view any image in a Microsoft window, type

      ``gm convert image.ext win:``

  Make sure Ghostscript is installed, otherwise, you will be unable to
  convert or view a Postscript document, and Postscript standard fonts will
  not be available.

  You may use any standard web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer) to browse
  the GraphicsMagick documentation.

  The Win2K executables will work under Windows '98 and later.

Windows Distribution Build Procedure
------------------------------------

  The following are the instructions for how to build a Q:8 (or Q:16)
  DLL-based distribution installer package using Visual Studio 2008
  Professional.  This is the same procedure used to produce the
  release packages:

  1. Install prerequisite software:

    a. Install Microsoft Visual Studio.

    b. Download and install Inno Setup 5
       <"http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">.

    c. Download and install ActiveState ActivePerl
       <"http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads/">.

  2. Build `GM\VisualMagick\configure\configure.exe` (if
     missing/outdated)

     a. Open workspace `GM\VisualMagick\configure\configure.dsp` by
        double-clicking from Windows Explorer.

     b. Upgrade Visual Studio project (as required)

     c. Select `Rebuild All` to build configure.exe

     d. Close the project.

  3. Configure Initial GraphicsMagick Visual Studio Workspace

     a. Use Windows Explorer to navigate to `GM\VisualMagick\configure`.

     b. Double-click on `configure.exe` to run configure program.

     c. Select desired build options: DLL build, Quantum Depth, 64-bit, OpenMP)

     d. Check `Build demo and test programs`.

     e. Finish remaining configure wizard screens to complete.

     f. `File` -> `Close Workspace`.

  2. Open Workspace, set build configuration, build GraphicsMagick software.

     a. Open workspace `GM\VisualMagick\configure\configure.sln` by
        double-clicking from Windows Explorer.

     b. Build -> "Set Active Configuration" -> "All - Win32 Release" -> OK

     c. Optionally enable 64-bit (WIN64) compilation.  "`Build` /
        `Configuration Manager...` / `Active Solution Platform` /
        `New` / `x64`".

     d. Open `CORE_magick\magick\magick_config.h` and edit any
        configuration settings you would like to change.  For example,
        you might change QuantumDepth to 16 for a"Q:16" build.

     e. If using Visual Studio Professional Edition, and OpenMP
        support is desired, then select `CORE_magick` in the Solution
        Explorer pane and use the right mouse button menu to select
        `Properties`.  In `Configuration Properties` / `C/C++` /
        `Language` set OpenMP support to 'yes'.

     f. Select "Rebuild All"

     g. Click on '!' icon to run configure program

     h. Select DLL build

     i. Check `Build demo and test programs`.

     j. Click on Edit `magick_config.h` and verify desired settings
        such as QuantumDepth.  You can also defer this step to later
        by opening the header file
        ``CORE_magick\include\magick_config.h`` in the Visual Studio
        project.

     k. Finish remaining configure wizard screens to complete.

     l. File -> `Close Workspace`

  3. Build ImageMagickObject

     a. Open Visual Studio Command Shell Window for WIN32 or WIN64

     b. Change to GraphicsMagick project directory ``GM``

     c. ``cd GM\contrib\win32\ATL7\ImageMagickObject``

     d. ``BuildImageMagickObject clean``

     e. ``BuildImageMagickObject release``

     f. ``cd ..\..\..\..``

  4. Build PerlMagick extension

     a. Open Visual Studio Command Shell Window for WIN32  or WIN64

     b. Change to GraphicsMagick project directory ``GM``

     c. ``cd GM\PerlMagick``

     d. ``nmake clean`` (only if this is a rebuild)

     e. ``C:\Perl32\bin\perl.exe Makefile.nt`` (or Perl64)

        Note that if multiple Perl's are installed, then it may be
