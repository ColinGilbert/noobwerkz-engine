Introduction
------------

*Magick++* is the object-oriented C++ API to the GraphicsMagick_
image-processing library, the most comprehensive open-source image
processing package available. Read the ChangeLog_ for *Magick++*.

*Magick++* supports an object model which is inspired by PerlMagick_.
Images support implicit reference counting so that copy constructors and
assignment incur almost no cost. The cost of actually copying an image
(if necessary) is done just before modification and this copy is managed
automatically by *Magick++*. De-referenced copies are automatically
deleted. The image objects support value (rather than pointer) semantics
so it is trivial to support multiple generations of an image in memory at
one time.

*Magick++* provides integrated support for the `Standard Template
Library`_ (`STL`) which is part of the standard C++ language so that
the powerful containers available (e.g. deque_, vector_, list_, and
map_) can be used to write programs similar to those possible with
PERL & PerlMagick_. STL-compatible template versions of
GraphicsMagick's list-style operations are provided so that operations
may be performed on multiple images stored in STL containers.

API
---

*Magick++* provides a simple C++ API to the GraphicsMagick image
processing library which supports reading and writing a huge number of
image formats as well as supporting a broad spectrum of traditional image
processing operations. The GraphicsMagick C API is complex and the data
structures are not well documented. *Magick++* provides access to most of
the features available from the C API but in a simple object-oriented and
well-documented framework.

*Magick++* is intended to support commercial-grade application
development. In order to avoid possible conflicts with the user's
application, all symbols contained in *Magick++* (included by the header
<Magick++.h>) are scoped to the namespace Magick. Symbols from the
GraphicsMagick C library are imported under the MagickLib namespace to
avoid possible conflicts and GraphicsMagick macros are only included
within the *Magick++* implementation so they won't impact the user's
application.

The InitializeMagick() function *MUST* be invoked before constructing
any Magick++ objects.  This used to be optional, but now it is
absolutely required.  This function initalizes semaphores and
configuration information necessary for the software to work
correctly.  Failing to invoke InitializeMagick() is likely to lead to
a program crash or thrown assertion.  If the program resides in the
same directory as the GraphicsMagick files, then argv[0] may be passed
as an argument so that GraphicsMagick knows where its files reside,
otherwise NULL may be passed and GraphicsMagick will try to use other
means (if necessary).

The core class in *Magick++* is the `Image`_ class. The `Image`_ class
provides methods to manipulate a single image frame (e.g. a JPEG image).
Standard Template Library (`STL`_) compatible algorithms and function
objects are provided in order to manipulate multiple image frames or to
read and write file formats which support multiple image frames (e.g. GIF
animations, MPEG animations, and Postscript files).

The `Image`_ class supports reference-counted memory management which
supports the semantics of an intrinsic variable type (e.g. 'int') with an
extremely efficient operator = and copy constructor (only a pointer is
assigned) while ensuring that the image data is replicated as required so
that it the image may be modified without impacting earlier generations.
Since the `Image`_ class manages heap memory internally, images are best
allocated via C++ automatic (stack-based) memory allocation. This support
allows most programs using *Magick++* to be written without using any
pointers, simplifying the implementation and avoiding the risks of using
pointers. When a program uses automatic memory allocation to allocate
*Magick++* images, that aspect of the program becomes naturally
exception-safe and thread-safe.

The image class uses a number of supportive classes in order to specify
arguments. Colors are specified via the `Color`_ class. Colors specified
in X11-style string form are implicitly converted to the `Color`_ class.
Geometry arguments (those specifying width, height, and/or x and y
offset) are specified via the `Geometry`_ class. Similar to the `Color`_
class, geometries specified as an X11-style string are implicitly
converted to the `Geometry`_ class. Two dimensional drawable objects are
specified via the `Drawable`_ class. Drawable objects may be provided as
a single object or as a list of objects to be rendered using the current
image options. `Montage`_ options (a montage is a rendered grid of
thumbnails in one image) are specified via the `Montage`_ class.

Errors are reported using C++ exceptions derived from the `Exception`_
class, which is itself derived from the standard C++ exception class.
Exceptions are reported synchronous with the operation and are caught by
the first matching try block as the stack is unraveled. This allows a
clean coding style in which multiple related *Magick++* commands may be
executed with errors handled as a unit rather than line-by-line. Since
the `Image`_ object provides reference-counted memory management,
unreferenced images on the stack are automatically cleaned up, avoiding
the potential for memory leaks.

For ease of access, the documentation for the available user-level
classes is available via the following table:

Obtaining Magick++
------------------

*Magick++* is included as part of GraphicsMagick_ source releases and may
be retrieved via `ftp`_ or `Mercurial`_.

Installation
------------

Installation is very easy since *Magick++* is part of GraphicsMagick_ and
is built by default. Once GraphicsMagick_ is built, then *Magick++* is
available for use.

Usage
-----

A helper script named *GraphicsMagick++-config* is installed in the same
directory as the GraphicsMagick *gm* program under Unix which assists
with recalling compilation options required to compile and link programs
which depend on *Magick++*. For example, the following command will
compile and link the source file example.cpp to produce the executable
example (notice that quotes are backward quotes)::

  c++ -o example example.cpp `GraphicsMagick++-config --cppflags --cxxflags
    --ldflags --libs`

Windows users may get started by manually editing a project file for one
of the *Magick++* demo programs.

It is necessary to initialize the GraphicsMagick library prior to
using the *Magick++* library. This initialization is performed by
passing the path to the GraphicsMagick DLLs (assumed to be in the same
directory as your program) to the InitializeMagick() function
call. This is commonly performed by providing the path to your program
(argv[0]) as shown in the following example::

  int main( int /*argc*/, char ** argv)
  {
    InitializeMagick(*argv);

If you don't have the path to your executable, then pass NULL and
usually the library will be found anyway. Besides helping to find the
GraphicsMagick DLL/library and configuration files, InitializeMagick()
initializes all of the semaphores and data necessary for a
multi-threaded program to be completely thread safe.  This step used
to be optional, but it is now absolutely required.  Failure to
initialize GraphicsMagick will result in an application crash.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report any bugs via the `GraphicsMagick Bug Tracker`_. Questions
regarding usage should be directed to `Bob Friesenhahn`_.
