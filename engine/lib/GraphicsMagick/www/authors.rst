Active GraphicsMagick Contributors
==================================

Bob Friesenhahn
		Principal maintainer of GraphicsMagick. Author of
		Magick++ (C++ API to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick).
		Author of module loader facility, automatic file
		identification (magic) support, Unix/Cygwin/MinGW
		configure/make facility, Windows setup.exe style
		installer, WMF renderer, C API documentation formatter,
		and the C, C++, and Perl test suites used by ImageMagick
		and GraphicsMagick.

Glenn Randers-Pehrson
		Contributed significantly to the utilities, including
		writing the 'gm' utility wrapper. Authored support for
		JNG, MNG, and PNG formats. Provided significant support
		for the BMP format. Significant improvements to the
		documentation, including creating a documentation
		authoring environment based on the <imdoc> format.
		Maintains the SourceForge mailing lists.

Jaroslav Fojtik
		Authored the ART, CUT, HRZ, JNX, MAC, MATLAB, TOPOL,
                and WPG coder modules. Improved the FITS and TXT coder
                modules.  VisualMagick 'configure' improvements and
                build testing/fixes for many versions of Microsoft
                Visual Studio.

Kenneth Xu
                Contributed the implementation of 'gm batch', a simple
                batch mode for GraphicsMagick.

Troy Patteson
                Contributed a several significant patches to fix image
                rotation bugs and improve image rotation performance,
                as well as an improved bi-linear interpolation
                implementation.

Sara Shafaei
                Contributed a number of Wand API functions as well as
                fixes for several composition operators.

Brendan Lane
                Contributed a large number of new Photoshop
                composition operators and alpha-channel fixes for
                existing ones.

Dirk Lemstra
                Contributed improvements to the VisualMagick configure
                program to support configuring more build options via
                the GUI dialogs and to deal with similarly named
                files.

Roman Hiestand
                Contributed WebP coder improvements.


Former GraphicsMagick Contributors
==================================

Mike Chiarappa
		Created and maintains the Borland C++ Builder 6.0 build
		environment for GraphicsMagick.

Daniel Kobras
		Provided many security patches and fixes from the Debian
		project.

William Radcliffe
		Author of the VisualMagick project configure facility for
		Visual C++. Author of FlashPix module. Author of the
		ImageMagickObject COM object for Windows. Author of the
		EMF, XTRN, and META coders. Significant contributions to
		the MSL, JPEG, TIFF, SVG, and URL coders. Authored
		"process" module support. Wrote the micro-timer facility
		used by 'identify'. Ported module loader support to
		Windows. Significantly improved polygon rendering
		performance.

Leonard Rosenthol
		Authored the 'conjure' utility and associated MSL
		execution environment. Provided MacOS support. Authored
		the CLIPBOARD, XCF, and PSD coders. Postscript and PDF
		expertise. Significant drawing enhancements including
		support for dash patterns, linecap stroking, clipping
		masks and a mask image.

Lars Ruben Skyum
		Contributed the -clippath functionality, added
		-define support, improved color profile support,
		and re-wrote the PS3 coder.

Rolf Schroedter
		Principal author of TclMagick.

David N. Welton
		Co-author of TclMagick, particularly in the Unix environment.

Mark Mitchell
                Contributed a new design for the web pages, including the
                formatting scripts, and converted many pages to the new
                format.

Richard Nolde
		Contributed code for converting between native floating
		point types, and short (16/24) bit float types.

Clément Follet
		Contributed Hald CLUT and ASC-CDL implementations.

John Sergeant
		Re-wrote the HP PCL writer to work much better,
		including support for compression.  Implemented
		support for CALS type 1 format.  Re-wrote the DICOM
		reader.

Roberto de Deus Barbosa Murta
                Contributed the adaptive threshold implementation
                (-lat), which executes in linear rather than quadratic
                time.


Other Contributors (via ImageMagick)
====================================

John Cristy
		Creator, principal author, and principal maintainer of
		ImageMagick, from which GraphicsMagick is originally
		derived (from ImageMagick 5.5.2).  Also the author of
		the Wand API to ImageMagick which is incorporated as
		a stand-alone library by GraphicsMagick.

Kelly Bergougnoux
		Authored the initial Cineon coder (which has since been
		replaced).

Christopher R. Hawks
		Authored the PALM coder.

Francis J. Franklin
		Ported the WMF coder to the libwmf 0.2 API.

Rick Mabry
		Contributed code to support filling drawn objects using a
		pattern image.
Nathan Brown
		Original author of the JP2 coder.

Kyle Shorter
		Original author of PerlMagick. Original author of the
		LOCALE coder.

Markus Friedl
		Original author of Base64 encode/decode sources.

David Harr
		Contributed (with Leonard Rosenthol) dash pattern,
		linecap stroking algorithm, and minor rendering
		improvements.

Troy Edwards
		Authored the source RPM spec file for GraphicsMagick.

Milan Votava

Additional Acknowledgements
===========================

David Pensak, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company
		For providing the computing environment that made
		developing ImageMagick possible.

Alexander Zimmermann
		Responsible for the ImageMagick Linux binary
		distributions for many years. His efforts are very much
		appreciated.
