The %OpenMesh mesh library is a powerful tool for handling polygonal
meshes. Due to its inherent generative structure it allows the user to
create mesh types which are custom tailored to the specific needs of
the application. The user can either supply his own data structures
for representing vertices, edges and faces or he can conveniently use
the predefined structures of %OpenMesh.
Additionally %OpenMesh offers dynamic properties allowing the user to attach
and detach data to the mesh during runtime.

This document is supposed to introduce the basic concepts of
%OpenMesh. <!--For detailed information, consult the online documentation
(\ref mesh_docu).-->

In this tutorial we will introduce the %OpenMesh library by means of
simple examples. The first one just builds a polygonal mesh
representing a cube and writes the result to standard output. The
following examples develop a simple mesh smoother: Recall that the
immediate neighbors of a vertex are called the 1-ring of this
vertex. It is well known that a polygonal mesh can be smoothed by
repeatedly replacing each vertex' position by the center of gravity
(cog) of its 1-ring. The basic smoother will

\li read a polygonal mesh from standard input,
\li compute the cog of the 1-ring of each vertex,
\li replace each vertex' position by its cog and finally,
\li write the mesh to standard output.
