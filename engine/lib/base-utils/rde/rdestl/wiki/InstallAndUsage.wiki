How to make best use of RDE stl in your projects

= Introduction =
  * Checkout/Export the source from SVN
  * Add the local copy to your IDE or Makefile's Include search path 
  * To include all RDE STL classes at once, {{{#include <rdestl.h>}}}
  * Add {{{RDE_DEBUG}}} to your debug configuration's preprocessor defines

Please note, to use {{{rde::string}}}, you must {{{#include <rde_string.h>}}}  (i.e. *not* {{{#include <string.h>}}} - this is to avoid confusion for you _and_ the compiler)

= Running Unit Tests (MSVC++ 2008) =
  * Get [http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net UnitTest++]
  * Add it to VC's include search path
  * Open Test/Build/Win32/stltest.sln
  * if needed, remove and re-add the !UnitTest++.vc2005.vcproj to your solution (no doubt your local copy of !UnitTest++ isn't in the same location as mine)
  * Build & Run
