I'm developing a rather minimalistic cross-platform game/simulation engine. This toolkit is made specifically to reduce wasted time (*cough cough* aside from the time it took to design and build this software *cough cough*.) Much of it consists of integrating external libraries, most of which are in C++11. It currently runs on Linux and Android. We can expect Windows, Mac, and iOS support quite soon. As a design goal, the legalese is designed to be extremely liberal (Apache 2.0.)

Still WIP.


Specific features:
```
A highly tunable gradient mapping shader by default. Comes with three XY-tileable ntextures blended into one.
Triplanar shader for non-UV mapped objects. Texture reads are kept to a minimum (3) by using the gradient mapping technique.
No significant obstacles between the programmer, the lower-level libraries and the data.
```

Currently brings in (among others):
```
Bgfx
glfw
reactphysics3d
Freetype
polyvox
Lemon Graph Library 
Assimp (and a working mesh loader, too! =P)
cppformat
```

To clone:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ColinGilbert/noobwerkz-engine.git
```

Program structure:
```
The current setup uses a platform-specific starter program to launch the main application.

There are many libraries - mostly math and scientific libraries - in the engine/lib directory.

Most engine code written in engine/common directory.

```

For the future, I plan on continuing work on it quite vigorously.


Things to do in the immediate future:
```
Continue refining the simulation world.
AI
Sound
Serialization
```

Medium future
```
Ports to Win, MacOS, iOS, Emscripten, NaCL
Test framework
Destructible worlds
```

Long-term
```
Dataviz
Cutting edge/esoteric programming idioms
```
