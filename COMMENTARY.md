Been cleaning up the codebase a lot this month. Most project time since has been spent on cleaning up the engine, learning OpenGL, and rethinking design to better take into account the new way things are being done while being as fast and readable as possible.

Begin proper OpenGL integration by removing bgfx.

Tried to make bgfx work by updating shaders in an effort to not be forced to refactor all graphics, but no go. :(
Continued to refactor graphics API.
Switched to Clang and refactored build flags in order to root out bugs. Found some.
