Been cleaning up the codebase a lot. Finally think I found a decent way to do instanced draws. Most project time since has been spent on cleaning, learning OpenGL, and rethinking the design to better take into account the new way things are being done while being as fast and understandable as possible.

Tried to make bgfx work by updating shaders in an effort to not be forced to refactor all graphics, but no go. :(
Continued to refactor graphics API.
Switched to Clang and refactored build flags in order to root out bugs. Found some.
