CHANGELOG:

Version 0.5 AKA: "StageCraft" (in progress)
```
Additions:
Integrate actors into engine (WIP)

Cleanups:
Remove git modules as they were causing problems
Make graphics class non-static
Banish use of -fpermissive from entire codebase
```


Version 0.4 AKA: "Auditory Delights"
```
Sound works properly
Engine finds native audio rate and resamples sound effects to it upon load.
Engine always plays audio at native rate.
```


Version 0.3 AKA: "Smorgasbord of Delights"
```
Began adding sound
Performance enhancements
Cleaned up components system
Created graph class (without exceptions!) to implement our own algorithms. Will eventually replace more cumbersome third-party libs that link in lots of extra binary and force exceptions onto the whole project.
Cleanups all over :P
```

Version 0.2.5: "Deboostify feat. Graphix Magix, Act Two"
```
Removed all calls to Boost in response to horrible porting experiences.
Added RNG function
Lighting
Repo cleanup
Nice API for scripts and C++
```

Version 0.2.0 AKA: "Graphix Magix, Act One"
```
Overhaul of the graphics system. Now allows for (eventual) easy batching of instanced objects using a very compact scene graph (it only holds tags stored in std::vector containers.)
Used to store extra meshes for no good reason. This stupidity was stopped and we now save lots of memory. :P
```

Version 0.1.1 AKA "Live reloads"
```
Moved out all non-stage components from stage into globals, enabling live reloads faster! Yay!
```

Version 0.1 AKA "HAHA we got scripting!"
```
Added proper working scripting and ported example to it. Was major PITA. :)
Minor/medium refactorings/cleanups.
Fixes to the triplanar shader.
```

Version 0.0.2 AKA "Starting to pull through"
```
Lots of cleanups.
Complete overhaul of stage class. Now properly keeps track of items, can compose entities, and has a far cleaner interface!
Fixed mesh loading. Now they do not need an open file on disk.
Default file opening interface that gives you the option to keep file cached in memory.
```

Version 0.0.1.1:
```
Code cleanups.
Issues and milestones done properly.
README.md given overhaul.
```

Version: 0.0.1, AKA: Fresh "beginnings":
```
Beginning of acceptable, almost modular interface.
```
